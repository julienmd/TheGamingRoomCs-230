# TheGamingRoomCs-230
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room, first had a game application, Draw It or Lose It, that was only created for Android systems. The client was interested in expanding their gaming app to multiple platforms using various software patterns in a distributed environment. Based on that The Gaming Room has asked us to evaluate the three traditional operating platforms (Linux, Mac, and Windows), as well as mobile platforms, for how the game application software could be deployed and run and what would be required to do so.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I detailed very clearly which option would be the best for The Gaming Room outlining the host operating framework, security guidelines and capacity.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The design document helped me keep focus on the task at hand and it made it easier for me to opt for the most important tasks that needed to be completed first.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would work on the Project Two Milestone since it was vital for the start of project two and would have made development easier from the beginning stages and since I did not submit it I lost valuable grade points and had to work on it before starting project two.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I looked at the the user's requirements and their specific needs and searched for tools that were adequate and tried to personalise them to the clients needs. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because it tries to fulfill the user’s needs. It aims to provide positive experiences that keep a user loyal to the product or brand. Additionally, a meaningful user experience allows you to define customer journeys on your product that are most conducive to business success.
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

-I looked at the specification of a software artifact which was best intended to accomplish the goals of our client while using a set of primitive components and subject to constraints. Therefore in my opinion it is best to use the object oriented approach in terms of strategy because the focus is on capturing the structure and behavior of information systems into small modules that combines both data and process which was best suited for our client The Gaming Room.
